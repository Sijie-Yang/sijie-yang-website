## Project Information

**RE-798**
Art Zone Reconstruction Plan 3.0

**Advisor** Prof. Hao Long, and Asso.Prof. Zuo Li

**Team Work** with Yi Ren and Zhuoyin Li

2021 Spring, Beijing

## Introduction

### [1] Urban Condition in the Field - Deconstruct the Evolution of 798 Art Zone

The project explores the evolution and transformation of 798 from an industrial factory to an art zone. Through analyzing the historical development, three distinct eras can be identified:

**ERA 1.0 - FACTORY**
The original industrial era focused on production and community building:
- Production Training
- Political Consolidation
- Part-time Learning
- Exercising
- Working in Factories
- Social Activities

**ERA 2.0 - ART ZONE**
The transformation into an art district brought new spatial and functional changes:
- Artist Studios
- Galleries
- Exhibition Spaces
- Cultural Events
- Creative Industries

**ERA 3.0 - MIX**
The future vision aims to create a balanced integration:
- Art-Industry Fusion
- Multi-functional Spaces
- Community Engagement
- Cultural Heritage Preservation

### [2] Spatial Strategy - Reconstruct Art Zone through Media Architecture

The reconstruction strategy focuses on creating a new spatial typology that combines:

1. **Space Replacement**
- Identifying key intervention points
- Preserving industrial heritage
- Creating new cultural spaces

2. **Structure Rationalization**
- Reinforcing existing structures
- Adapting industrial spaces
- Integrating new architectural elements

3. **Overlaid Space Generation**
- Creating multi-layered experiences
- Connecting different functional zones
- Establishing circulation networks

4. **Block Space Generation**
- Developing distinct spatial clusters
- Forming cultural corridors
- Building community nodes

The design incorporates three major components:
- Art Public Space: Integration of art and public activities
- New Media Art Center: Contemporary exhibition spaces
- Industrial Art Park: Preservation of industrial heritage

The project aims to create a sustainable model for industrial heritage transformation while maintaining the unique character of 798 as a cultural landmark.
