## About Me

I am a PhD student at the [Urban Analytics Lab](https://ual.sg), Department of Architecture, National University of Singapore (NUS), supervised by Prof. Filip Biljecki. I hold an MSc in Space Syntax from University College London (UCL) and a Bachelor of Architecture from Chongqing University. I am also pursuing a Master's in Computer Science at the School of Engineering and Applied Science, University of Pennsylvania.

My research explores the integration of new computational technologies (Computer Science, GIScience) with the study of the built environment. My aim is to advance knowledge in four key areas:

*   **Urban Intelligence:** Investigating the integrated development of urban intelligence through emerging technologies like IoT and AI.
*   **Urban Data:** Utilizing multi-source urban data to analyze and address complex urban challenges and uncover insights into urban dynamics.
*   **Urban Comfort:** Focusing on subjective, human-centered perceptions of comfort in urban spaces to evaluate and enhance sensory and experiential dimensions.
*   **Architectural Systems:** Conducting micro-scale investigations into architectural systems, including spatial configurations, building information systems, and sustainable green building solutions.

This website showcases my research interests, publications, projects, and CV.
