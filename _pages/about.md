My research focuses on how new computational technologies, including computer science and GIScience, can be applied to the study of the built environment, exploring the **potential relationship between the built environment and multiple social dimensions**, including the real estate economy, public health, human perception and behavior, and other social dimensions. I works on the basis of these studies to promote urban digital planning and sustainable development.

How to drive our understanding of urban environments with `multi-source urban data` is the focus of my work in current research activities, if you have interests on this topic, please feel free to contact me. I am open to further discussion and collaboration.

I am similarly interested in how traditional built environment design can be digitally driven, such as how algorithms and data in the context of digital technological development can be used to drive analysis and evaluation in architectural and urban design. In this field, I am particularly concerned with the cultural core as well as the multi-dimensional sustainability of design.
