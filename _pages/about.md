<!-- My research focuses on how new computational technologies, including computer science and GIScience, can be applied to the study of the built environment, exploring the **potential relationship between the built environment and multiple social dimensions**, including the real estate economy, public health, human perception and behavior, and other social dimensions. I works on the basis of these studies to promote urban digital planning and sustainable development.

How to drive our understanding of urban environments with `multi-source urban data` is the focus of my work in current research activities, if you have interests on this topic, please feel free to contact me. I am open to further discussion and collaboration.

I am similarly interested in how traditional built environment design can be digitally driven, such as how algorithms and data in the context of digital technological development can be used to drive analysis and evaluation in architectural and urban design. In this field, I am particularly concerned with the cultural core as well as the multi-dimensional sustainability of design. -->

I am a PhD student at Urban Analysis Lab, Department of Architecture, National University of Singapore, where my PhD supervisor is Prof. Filip Biljecki. I hold MSc in Space Syntax from University College London and Bachelor of Architecture from Chongqing University. In addition, I am a computer science master's student at the School of Engineering and Applied Science, University of Pennsylvania.

My research explores the integration of new computational technologies, including Computer Science and GIScience, with the study of the built environment. I aim to advance knowledge in four key areas:

- **Urban Intelligence** Investigating the integrated development of urban intelligence through emerging technologies, including the Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI).
- **Urban Data** Utilizing multi-source urban data to analyze and address complex urban challenges, to uncover insights into the interactions between the built environment and urban dynamics.
- **Urban Comfort** Focusing on subjective, human-centered perceptions of comfort in urban spaces, to evaluate and enhance the sensory and experiential dimensions of urban environments.
- **Architectural Systems** Conducting micro-scale investigations into architectural systems, including spatial configurations, building information systems, and sustainable green building solutions.
